                """Create a TransportRequest with the following parameters:

                url - The url that the transport engine should retrieve

                filepath - If defined, the transport engine will download the
                file to this path.  If not defined, the caller should
                supply a write function.

                writefunc - A function, supplied instead of filepath, that
                reads the bytes supplied by the transport engine and writes
                them somewhere for processing.  This is a callback.

                hdrfunc - A callback for examining the contents of header
                data in a response to a transport request.

                header - A dictionary of key/value pairs to be included
                in the request's header.

                compressible - A boolean value that indicates whether
                the content that is requested is a candidate for transport
                level compression.

                data - If the request is sending a data payload, include
                the data in this argument.

                failonerror - If the request returns a HTTP code >= 400,
                terminate the request early, instead of running it to
                completion.

                httpmethod - If the request is a HTTP/HTTPS request,
                this can override the default HTTP method of GET.

                progtrack - If the transport wants the engine to update
                the progress of the download, supply a ProgressTracker
                object in this argument.

                progclass - If the transport was supplied with a ProgressTracker
                this must point to a class that knows how to wrap the progress
                tracking object in way that allows the transport to invoke
                the proper callbacks.  The transport instantiates an object
                of this class before beginning the request.

                progfunc - A function to be used as a progress callback.
                The preferred method is is use progtrack/progclass, but
                light-weight implementations may use progfunc instead,
                especially if they don't need per-file updates.

                read_filepath - If the request is sending a file, include
                the path here, as this is the most efficient way to send
                the data.

                read_fobj - If the request is sending a large payload,
                this points to a fileobject from which the data may be
                read.

                repouri - This is the URL stem that identifies the repo.
                It's a subset of url.  It's also used by the stats system.

                sslcert - If the request is using SSL, HTTPS for example,
                provide a path to the SSL certificate here.

                sslkey - If the request is using SSL, like HTTPS for example,
                provide a path to the SSL key here.

                uuid - In order to remove the request from the list of
                many possible requests, supply a unique identifier in uuid.

                proxy - If the request should be performed using a proxy,
                that proxy should be specified here.

                runtime_proxy - In order to avoid repeated environment lookups
                we pass the proxy that should be used at runtime, which may
                differ from the 'proxy' value.

                system - whether this request is on behalf of a system
                publisher.  Usually this isn't necessary, as the
                TransportRepoURI will have been configured with correct proxy
                and runtime_proxy properties.  However, for direct access to
                resources served by the system-repository, we use this to
                prevent $http_proxy environment variables from being used.

                A TransportRequest must contain enough information to uniquely
                identify any pkg.client.publisher.TransportRepoURI - in
                particular, it must contain all fields used by
                TransportRepoURI.key() which is currently the (url, proxy)
                tuple, and is used as the key when recording/retrieving
                transport statistics."""
