        """ Set up environment for doing testing.

            We set PYTHONPATH and PATH so that they reference the proto
            area, and clear packaging related environment variables
            (every variable prefixed with PKG_).

            path_to_proto should be a relative path indicating a path
            to proto area of the workspace.  So, if your test case is
            three levels deep: ex. src/tests/cli/foo.py, this should be
            "../../../proto"

            This function looks at argv[0] to compute the ultimate
            path to the proto area; this is nice because you can then
            invoke test cases like normal commands; i.e.:
            "python cli/t_my_test_case.py" will just work.

            If 'covdir' is provided, coverage will be started and the
            related coverage object returned.

            If 'system_test' is True, tests will run on live system.
